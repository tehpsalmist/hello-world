# hello-world
Greetings from Ben Steward!

This simple project is in fulfillment of the first homework assignment in the Node.js Master Class.

To run this project locally, 

1. `git clone`

2. Create your own `https` folder at the root containing valid key.pem and cert.pem files to use the https server.

3. Run with `node .` or, to specify production mode, `NODE_ENV=production node .`.

4. Hit the `/hello` endpoint of whatever port is available based on what you ran in step 3, and if you send a greeting in a POST request, you will get a reply, and an echo of your greeting.

Enjoy.
