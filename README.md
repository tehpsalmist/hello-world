# hello-world
Greetings from Ben Steward!

I originally decided to jump into computer code in attempt to stay relevant in the workplace--a very general goal. It didn't take long to realize that I really love this stuff! Once I got comfortable enough with basic HTML/CSS, I started putting together little websites and landing pages for various events (anything I could, really), and now I'm starting to venture into larger projects using various JS frameworks and libraries. Feel free to browse through my work and send any feedback to ronyfan102@gmail.com.
