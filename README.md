# hello-world
Greetings from Ben Steward!

This simple project is in fulfillment of the first homework assignment in the Node.js Master Class.

To run this project locally, after `git clone`ing, you will need to create your own `https` folder at the root and create your own key.pem and cert.pem files to use the https server. Enjoy.
